🛠️ 1. Required Hardware

ESP32-CAM module (with OV2640 camera, already attached).

FTDI USB-to-Serial programmer (3.3V, supports 5V supply).

Jumper wires (female-female).

Breadboard (optional).

USB cable (to connect FTDI → laptop).

⚠️ ESP32-CAM has no onboard USB, so you need the FTDI module for programming.

🔌 2. Wiring ESP32-CAM to FTDI Programmer
ESP32-CAM Pin	FTDI Programmer Pin
5V	5V
GND	GND
U0R (RX)	TX
U0T (TX)	RX
IO0	GND (only during programming)

👉 Notes:

Connect IO0 → GND when uploading code. Remove it after flashing.

ESP32-CAM can draw up to 300 mA → make sure your FTDI can supply enough current.

💻 3. Arduino IDE Setup

Install Arduino IDE (latest version).

Add ESP32 board support:

File → Preferences → add this URL:

https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json


Tools → Board → Board Manager → search ESP32, install.

Select board:

Board: AI Thinker ESP32-CAM

Partition Scheme: Huge APP (3MB, No OTA)

Upload Speed: 115200 baud

Programmer: AVR ISP (default)

📜 4. Example Code (CameraWebServer)

In Arduino IDE:

File → Examples → ESP32 → Camera → CameraWebServer

Change this part (near top of sketch):

// Select camera model
#define CAMERA_MODEL_AI_THINKER

#include "camera_pins.h"


Update Wi-Fi credentials:

const char* ssid = "YourWiFiName";
const char* password = "YourWiFiPassword";


Upload code (hold IO0 to GND).
After success → disconnect IO0 from GND and reset ESP32-CAM.

🌐 5. Run the Camera

Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud).

ESP32-CAM connects to Wi-Fi → prints IP address.
Example:

WiFi connected
Camera ready! Use 'http://192.168.1.42' to connect


Open that IP in browser → see live video stream.

You’ll get options like: resolution, quality, face detection, face recognition.

🛠️ 6. Troubleshooting (Root Guidance)
⚡ Upload Issues

"Failed to connect" error → check IO0 is grounded during upload, reset module once.

Wrong COM port → check FTDI driver installed.

⚡ Power Issues

ESP32-CAM keeps rebooting → power supply too weak. Use separate 5V 1A supply if FTDI can’t provide enough current.

⚡ No Camera Found

Ensure correct board (AI Thinker ESP32-CAM).

Check #define CAMERA_MODEL_AI_THINKER is uncommented.

⚡ Stream Laggy

Start with lower resolution (e.g., QVGA 320×240).



ESP32 is not a high-speed camera board, so higher res (SVGA, XGA) reduces FPS.
